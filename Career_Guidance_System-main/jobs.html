                                    You can pursue Masters in Business Administration (MBA) to build your career in management or turn your technical knowledge into a successful business. Pursuing an MBA degree can benefit BTech graduates in many other ways. For instance, studying MBA can help develop your managerial skills, start your own company and land higher posts in an organisation. There are also a lot of MBA specialisations that you can pursue. For instance, you can pursue an MBA in sales, marketing, human resource, finance, operations, banking & financial services and business analytics.

To apply for MBA, you typically need to crack the entrance exam recognised by the colleges you wish to apply to. While there are a number of such exams, the Common Admission Test (CAT) is accepted by most of the leading management institutes.

                                    You can enrol in a post-graduation programme after your BTech. It is an excellent path for students looking to enhance their subject expertise and gain specialised knowledge. Getting a master's degree can also help you get senior-level jobs and earn a higher salary. Some of the common MTech specialisations that students can opt for include:

software engineering
electrical engineering
computer science and engineering
power systems engineering
mechanical engineering
thermal engineering
chemical engineering
machine design
To apply for MTech, you must have a valid score in the respective entrance exams accepted by the colleges. The primary national-level entrance exam accepted by the top institutes like the Indian Institutes of Technology ( IITs), National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) is the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE). Several colleges also accept state-level entrance exams such as Post Graduate Common Entrance Test (PGCET).

                                    If you aspire to work in the government sector, serve the country and want a job with good pay and perks, then UPSC can be the ideal choice. To join Civil Service, you have to clear the UPSC Civil Services Exam. Following that, you are eligible to apply for over twenty government services including the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Foreign Service (IFS), Indian Revenue Service (IRS) and the Indian Police Service (IPS) based on your score.

The UPSC also conducts exams specifically for engineering graduates, such as the Engineering Services Examination (ESE) and the Combined Engineering Services (CES) examination. Clearing these exams makes you eligible for varied government engineering positions. Choose which UPSC exams you want to sit, depending on your interest and career goals. If you are interested in general public services, then Civil Services is the ideal option. If you are inclined to engineering and technical jobs, then Engineering Services is the way to go.

                                    Many engineering graduates choose to start their own company right out of college. So if you have creativity, an idea for a great product or service, a passion for solving problems and the ability to take calculated risks, then you can consider starting a business.

Setting up a business or startup often involves a lot of research, planning, fundraising, marketing and handling legal tasks. So you consider getting assistance from your college's startup incubator. If your idea has potential, you may even get a boost from many venture capital firms promoting student-led and college-graduate startups.

                                    The Indian Army is one of the most prestigious professions in the country. If you are enthusiastic about serving the nation and want a rather adventurous career, then joining the Indian Armed Forces can be a good choice for you. You may choose to apply for any of the three wings—the Indian Army, the Indian Airforce or the Indian Navy. Selection criteria and requirements for each wing vary.

Apart from the combat roles, engineering graduates also have opportunities for technical roles through varied entry schemes such as Technical Graduate Course (TGS), University Entry Scheme (UES), Short Service Commission - Technical (SSC) and Special Naval Architect Entry Scheme (SNAES)

                                    Studying abroad provides you with a world-class education and international exposure. You also get to choose diverse options of colleges and courses, expanding your scope of educational opportunities. In fact, graduates with international degrees are highly valued in the global market, making them more employable. And if you have plans of settling abroad, then studying in certain countries can improve your prospect of getting permanent residence. Many students pursue studies in a foreign country, get a work permit there and then apply for permanent residence.

                                    To study abroad, you have to meet the necessary criteria of the college and the country's immigration policies. You may want to visit the college website to check the available programs, course details, requirements, admission procedure and important dates. Many colleges even provide counselling to assist international students with the admission process.

                                    You can also consider turning your passion into your career. For example, if you are enthusiastic about fitness, then become a certified trainer and get a job as a fitness instructor. Or if you aspire to become an actor, then join a drama school and give auditions for acting roles. Unlike other options after BTech, this does not have a well-trodden path. So you may want to explore different paths and learn along the way. Practise your craft, get qualified and find ways to earn from it.
